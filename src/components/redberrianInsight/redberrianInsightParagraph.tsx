                    We were soo much fun before the pandemic
                    started! Parties almost every weekend and
                    lavish employee birthday celebrations!
                    Unfortunately, covid ruined that fun
                    like it did almost everything else in
                    the world. But we try our best to zhuzh
                    it up a bit. For example, we host biweekly
                    Devtalks where our senior and lead developers
                    talk about topics they are passionate about.
                    Previous topics have included Web3, NFT,
                    Laravel 9, Kubernetes, etc. We hold these
                    talks in the office but you can join our
                    Zoom broadcast as well. Feel free to join
                    either as an attendee or a speaker!
