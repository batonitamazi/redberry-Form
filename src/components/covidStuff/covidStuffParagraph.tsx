          As this infamous pandemic took over the world,
          we adjusted our working practices so that our
          employees can be as safe and comfortable as possible.
          We have a hybrid work environment, so you can either
          work from home or visit our lovely office on Sairme
          Street. If it was up to us, we would love you
          to see us in the office because we think face-to-face
          communications {'>'} Zoom meetings. Both on the fun
          and productivity scales.
